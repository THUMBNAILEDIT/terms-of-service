                Welcome to THUMBNAILED.IT! This Terms of Service ("Terms")
                constitutes a legally binding agreement between Private
                Entrepreneur Yaremchuk Vadym Olegovych ("THUMBNAILED.IT"), also
                referred to in this document by “we”, “our”, “us”, organized
                under the laws of Ukraine, and the Customer ("Customer") for the
                provision of our monthly subscription-based services for
                providing graphic design services ("Services"). The site works
                as is and as available. By accessing or using our Services, you
                agree to be bound by these Terms. Failure to agree to and adhere
                to all Terms, conditions, and obligations contained herein
                results in the prohibition of the Customer's use of the

              <p class="terms__list-text">
                The following outlines the Service Plans offered by
                THUMBNAILED.IT, subject to the terms and conditions herein.
                Customers acknowledge that payments are for the provision of
                services rendered during the service period, and not for the
                delivery of specific quantities of any deliverables.
                Circumstances may arise that prevent the fulfillment of specific
                deliverable quantities; hence, subscriptions are charged on a
                per-service-period basis, with each period being one month in
                duration. THUMBNAILED.IT offers three subscription plans: Basic,
                Premium, and Individual. Basic Plan: At a monthly rate of $499,
                this plan offers an unlimited amount of thumbnail requests and
                revisions, with a right to request 1 thumbnail every 72 hours.
                The deliverables for each request consist of 1 thumbnail. This
                plan offers Slack support. Premium Plan: At a monthly rate of
                $1999, this plan offers an unlimited amount of thumbnail
                requests and revisions, with a right to request 1 thumbnail
                every 48 hours. The deliverables for each request consist of 2
                thumbnail options as a part of the A / B testing, provided in
                this Pricing Plan, a title for the video chosen as a result of
                video title SEO provided in this Pricing Plan, a banner and a
                profile picture for the Customer’s YouTube channel and a
                branding guideline. This plan offers Slack support. Individual
                Plan: Starting at a monthly rate of $5000, this Pricing Plan
                includes everything provided in the Premium Plan, but also adds
                a wide variety of opportunities for customization, which will be
                discussed individually on the call. All Subscription Plans are
                subject to modification, enhancement, or revision at the sole
                discretion of THUMBNAILED.IT. Current customers are informed of
                any changes to the terms of the Subscription Plans at least one
                full billing cycle prior to any changes. Those who wish to
                become customers are advised to regularly review the terms of
                the Subscription Plans for updates.

              <p class="terms__list-text">
                Customers may cancel their subscription at any time. However, no
                refunds are offered under any circumstances. In the event of a
                cancellation, THUMBNAILED.IT ensures that the Customer will
                continue to receive the service as promised until the end of the

                Customers can submit one thumbnail request at a time, providing
                the necessary information and materials specified to them during
                the work. The turnaround time allocated for completing one
                thumbnail request varies depending on the Subscription Plan, and
                customers are not to request the next thumbnail before the end
                of the turnaround time of the current thumbnail request. Once
                the thumbnail is completed, it will be sent to the customer for
                review via an agreed upon channel, specifically Asana or Slack,
                and revisions can be requested within 48 hours after the
